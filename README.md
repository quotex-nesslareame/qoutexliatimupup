## What is a Trading Strategy?

A trading strategy is a set of rules that you use to guide your trading
decisions. A well-defined trading strategy will help you to identify
trading opportunities, manage your risk, and maximize your profits.
There are many different types of trading strategies, and the best
strategy for you will depend on your individual trading style and risk
tolerance.

## Essential Elements of a Successful Trading Strategy

    opportunities by analyzing the market. This can be done using
    technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of both.

    setting stop-loss orders and position sizing correctly.
